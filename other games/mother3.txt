cutscenes can be slow
	feels like too many dead moments for a game w no voice acting
i could give speed a random modifier like pokemon damage
combat in chapter feels simple and mashy
	doesnt explain combat's main gimmick - sound battles
	doesnt give u access to spells
	feels like im using level 5 pokemon
very good story w a lot of characters
impressive very simple visuals i should take more notes on
	animations
	fade in/out
	colors and such
