generally
	brighter highlights shift towards yellow and decrease saturation/increase brightness
	darker shading shifts towards purple and decreases brightness/increase saturation
		can also decrease saturation for more natural looking shading at the cost of vibrance
hue shifting is certainly necessary but the amount u shift can vary
